# HousingApp
This code is for a web application for houses on sale or for rental. It provides all the necessary details and pictures of each house, so that people who wish to see the houses don't have to physically go view the house.
It also helps with the applications for the houses by having a form right at the bottom of the details' page where applicants can submit their details if they are interested in a house.

The approach to solving this was to make available all information that a person may require to make a decision of buying/renting a property, and enabling them to show interest in a propeerty by submitting their details online through a form.
